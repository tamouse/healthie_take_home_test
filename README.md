## Short answer ##

Answer with something like 1â€“4 sentences. We aren't looking for a precise technical definition. Answer in a way that you think is relevant to your software engineering work. If you don't know an answer, don't copy/paste from the web - just give whatever info you know.

  * What is HTML?
  * What is CSS?
  * What is the DOM?
  * What is memory?
  * What is TCP/IP?
  * In a programming language, what is a class?
  * In a database, what is a foreign key?
  * What is Model View Controller?
  
### What is HTML? ###

HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language" and is a declarative language for marking up *content* on a web page so the browser can determine *what* the structure of the content is.

### What is CSS? ###

CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets" and is declarative language a browser uses for determining the appearance of the HTML content. The cascading part of the name indicates that the formatting rules are inherited fromr rules with more specificity.

## What is the DOM? ##

DOM stands for "Document Object Model" which is determined by converting the HTML and CSS rules into syntax tree with properties that can be manipulated via JavaScript.

### What is memory? ###

Memory is how a computer keeps track of information it's operating upon, or which has been persisted in some way. There are different classes of memory including fast level 1 and level 2 cache which is held on the CPU (Computer Processing Unit), to RAM in the system, today typically measured in Gigabites, on to local disk / storage, remote storage, and cloud storage.

## What is TCP/IP? ##

The standard way applications running on differnt computers communicate. TCP is "Transmission Control Protocol" and deals with making sure information transmission is in the proper order and is reliably transmitted from end to end. IP is "Internet Protocol" and deals with assembling and disassembling smaller, well-known sized packets of information, however is designed to continue operating in an unreliable environment.

### In a programming language, what is a class? ###

For Object Oriented programming languages, a *class* is a definition (template, prototype, etc) for creating instances, *objects*, that carry out the programming instructions. In several OO langs, classes can inherit from other classes, making definition of classes both less complex in the number of methods needing to be defined, and more complex in the number of inherited classes.

### In a database, what is a foreign key? ###

A foreign key is a *constrained* way of tying a dependent table to an independent table. The foreign key contraints provide considerable protect of data integrity.

### What is Model View Controller? ###

The collection of architecture patterns that define the workings of a modern 3-tier web applicaiton. (E.g. Rails, Django, Sails)

1. The Controller receives requests from a client, often a browser on a human user's computer, and provides a response after processing the request.
2. The Views are templates and instructions for detailed assembly of the content that is returned in the respionse the Controller gives.
3. The Model consists of operating instructions to deal with persistence, calculations, background work, i.e., anything that's not handled in Controllers and Views. Persistence Models are tied to a backing database or datastore. Other models can be pure funcitonality.



## Coding ##

For these challenges, you may write any code you wish in order to implement your answer. Please provide code in a runable file, with some instructions in comments at the top for how to run it.
 
### Prime Number Finder ###

Write a function that looks for prime numbers for a certain amount of time. When that amount of time has elapsed, it prints the largest prime number it found, and then returns nil. invoked like this to run for 5 seconds: find_prime_number(5)

> **NOTE:** Find the implementation at `./lib/prime_numbers/` of the Rails root directory. There is a [README](./lib/prime_numbers/README.md) in that directory explaining more about the implementation,

### Class design ###

Create classes Cat, Dog, Chicken, CatFood, DogFood, HumanFood, Lemons

  * a cat likes CatFood, Chicken, and Milk
  * a dog likes DogFood, CatFood, Chicken, HumanFood
  * a Cat can meow and a Dog can bark (print "meow" or "bark" to STDOUT)
  * when an animal eats food it likes, it makes a noise three times
  * when an animal eats food it dislikes, it makes a noise one time
  * You can implement this any way you like, with whatever api you think makes sense.

Include a driver file which requires the files, instantiates the classes, and invokes the methods to demonstrate the functionality.

> **NOTE:** The implementation is in `./lib/class_design/` and there is a [README](./lib/class_design/README.md) in that folder with a bit more info.

### Database and model design with queries ###

We want to model providers (e.g. dietitians), their clients, and journal entries.

  * Both providers and clients have a name and an email address.
  * Providers have many clients
  * Clients usually have one Provider but can have more than one.
  * Clients have a plan that they paid for, signified by the string "basic" or "premium". For each provider that a client is signed up with, they have 1 plan.
  * Clients post journal entries. These consist of freeform text.
 
We want to be able to do these queries:

  * Find all clients for a particular provider
  * Find all providers for a particular client
  * Find all of a particular client's journal entries, sorted by date posted
  * Find all of the journal entries of all of the clients of a particular provider, sorted by date posted
 
Using ActiveRecord, Django, or another system you enjoy using, create the classes and schema migrations for this, including indexes.
 
Show how to do each of the queries listed above.
 
If you are torn between multiple approaches, just choose one to implement and explain the other approach and what the pros and cons of each might be.

# Notes on answering the take home test #

## Structure ##

As the final set of questions fit best into using Ruby on Rails, I decided to create a very minimal API-based rails repo, to which I can supply the answers to test quesitons.

## Answers for Coding: Database and model design with queries ##

I thought a few different ways to demonstrate the queries:

1. Using tests
2. Using a runner
3. Creating controllers

Number 3 was the more complicated, while number 1 would have taken extra work to generate interesting output. Number 2 was the simplest way to show the queries.

In `./scripts/queries_for_tht.rb` is a Rails runner with methods in a class to show the actual queries as they would be done with ActiveRecord. To run:

``` shell
bin/rails runner scripts/queries_for_tht.rb 
```

# Setting up this repo for examination of answers #

## Versions used ##

  * Ruby: 3.1.1
  * Bundler: 2.3.26
  * Rails: 7.0.4.2

## System dependencies ##

  * SQLite database system, for demo purposes only
  * ActiveSupport::TestCase and others bundled with Rails, i.e., no RSpec

## Configuration ##

  * Development configuation should all be fine for evaluation purposes.
  * Run `bin/rails db:setup` (or `bin/rails db:reset` if database files already exist) to (re-)create a populated dev environment

## Starting the server ##

  * Run `bin/rails server` to bring up the server
  * Run `open http://localhost:3000/` to get a verification the server is running

## How to run the test suite ##

  * Tests are run using `bin/rails test`
